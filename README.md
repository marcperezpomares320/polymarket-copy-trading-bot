# Polymarket Copy-Trading Bot (aka “CTRL+C, CTRL+TRADE”)

A **TypeScript/Node** bot that **mirrors a target Polymarket trader’s activity** and places similar orders from *your* account—because some people do technical analysis and some people do… **social analysis**.

If you’ve been looking for:
- **polymarket bot**
- **polymarket copy trading**
- **polymarket trading bot typescript**
- **clob client bot**

…you’re in the right repo.

## What it does

- **Watches** a target user (address or username → proxy) on Polymarket
- **Polls periodically** and fetches recent activity
- **Copies trades** to your account with optional risk controls (multiplier, max order size, trades-only mode)

---

## What it *doesn’t* do

- **No profit guarantees**. If the target trader jumps off a cliff, the bot will politely ask if you’d like to join them.
- **Not a “magic arbitrage printer.”** It’s copy-trading. (If you want true arbitrage, you’ll likely need additional routing, pricing, and latency work.)

## Quick start (5 minutes, assuming the market gods allow it)

### Prereqs

- **Node.js**: `>= 20`
- **A funded Polymarket account**
- Your **EOA private key** and **Polymarket proxy/funder address** (from the Polymarket UI)

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure

Create `.env` from the example:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your values (see below).

### Run (dev)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run (production-ish)

```bash
npm start
```

---

## Configuration

All config is via environment variables (see `.env.example`).

### Copy target

Pick one:
- **`COPY_TARGET_USER`**: target proxy address *or* username (the bot will try to resolve username → proxy)

### Core knobs

| Variable | What it controls | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `COPY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | How often to poll for new activity | `15000` |
| `COPY_ACTIVITY_LIMIT` | How many recent activities to consider per poll | `100` |
| `COPY_SIZE_MULTIPLIER` | Multiply copied trade size | `1` |
| `COPY_MAX_ORDER_USD` | Hard cap per copied order (0 = no cap) | `25` |
| `COPY_TRADES_ONLY` | If `true`, avoids copying non-trade activity | `true` |

### Your wallet / Polymarket account

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| `POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY` | ✅ | 64 hex chars (with or without `0x`) |
| `POLYMARKET_ADDRESS` | ✅ | Your Polymarket proxy/funder address (from UI) |
| `POLYMARKET_SIGNATURE_TYPE` | ❌ | Usually auto-detected; override only if needed |
| `POLYMARKET_CHAIN_ID` | ❌ | Defaults to Polygon in most setups |

## Safety / “please don’t DM me at 3AM”

- **Never commit your `.env`**. If you do, the internet will treat it like free samples at Costco.
- Consider running on a **fresh wallet** with limited funds while testing.
- Start with `COPY_SIZE_MULTIPLIER=0.1` and a small `COPY_MAX_ORDER_USD`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **`POLYMARKET_PRIVATE_KEY is required...`**  
  Your key is missing or not valid hex. The bot accepts **64 hex chars** with optional `0x`.

- **“Could not resolve username to proxy”**  
  Use a **proxy address** (0x…) for `COPY_TARGET_USER` or set the correct target.

## FAQ

### Is this “arbitrage”?
It can be part of an arbitrage workflow, but by itself it’s primarily **copy trading**. If you’re building true arbitrage, you’ll probably add market scanning, price diff logic, and execution routing.

### Is it fast?
It’s **poll-based** (`COPY_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`). If you need low-latency mirroring, you’ll want a streaming approach.
